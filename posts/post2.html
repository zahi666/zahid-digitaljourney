      <p>The iPhone 17 Pro Max launched in September 2025, and it’s turning heads. With powerful specs, improved battery life, new camera features, and better connectivity, it promises a lot. But is it really worth upgrading from older models? Let’s dive in.</p>
      <h2>Key specs & features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Powerful chipset and improved RAM/storage options.</li>
        <li>~6.9-inch OLED ProMotion display with 120Hz refresh.</li>
        <li>Battery improvements and optimized power delivery.</li>
        <li>Camera upgrades with high-res sensors and better low-light performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're using a much older iPhone, the upgrade makes sense. But if you already own a recent Pro/Pro Max, evaluate which features matter to you before buying.</p>
